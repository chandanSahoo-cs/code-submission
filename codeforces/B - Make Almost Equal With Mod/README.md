xi - Solar Storm⠀You are given an array a1,a2,…,an of distinct positive integers. You have to do the following operation exactly once:  choose a positive integer k;  for each i from 1 to n, replace ai with ai mod k†. Find a value of k such that 1≤k≤1018 and the array a1,a2,…,an contains exactly 2 distinct values at the end of the operation. It can be shown that, under the constraints of the problem, at least one such k always exists. If there are multiple solutions, you can print any of them.† a mod b denotes the remainder after dividing a by b. For example:   7 mod 3=1 since 7=3⋅2+1  15 mod 4=3 since 15=4⋅3+3  21 mod 1=0 since 21=21⋅1+0

### Input
InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤500). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2≤n≤100) — the length of the array a.The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤1017) — the initial state of the array. It is guaranteed that all the ai are distinct.Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.

### Output
OutputFor each test case, output a single integer: a value of k (1≤k≤1018) such that the array a1,a2,…,an contains exactly 2 distinct values at the end of the operation.
NoteIn the first test case, you can choose k=7. The array becomes [8 mod 7,15 mod 7,22 mod 7,30 mod 7]=[1,1,1,2], which contains exactly 2 distinct values ({1,2}).In the second test case, you can choose k=30. The array becomes [0,0,8,0,8], which contains exactly 2 distinct values ({0,8}). Note that choosing k=10 would also be a valid solution.In the last test case, you can choose k=1018. The array becomes [2,1], which contains exactly 2 distinct values ({1,2}). Note that choosing k=1018+1 would not be valid, because 1≤k≤1018 must be true.
