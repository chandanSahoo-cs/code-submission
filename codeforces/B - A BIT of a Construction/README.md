# [B. A BIT of a Construction](https://codeforces.com/contest/1957/problem/B)

---
Given integers n and k, construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. ≥0) integers a1,a2,…,an such that   n∑i=1ai=k  The number of 1s in the binary representation of a1|a2|…|an is maximized, where | denotes the bitwise OR operation.

### Input
InputThe first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1≤n≤2⋅105, 1≤k≤109) — the number of non-negative integers to be printed and the sum respectively.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

### Output
OutputFor each test case, output a sequence a1,a2,…,an on a new line that satisfies the conditions given above.If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.
NoteIn the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can only output 5 as the answer.In the second test case, we output 1,2 which sum up to 3, and 1|2=(11)2 has two 1s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.In the fourth test case, we output 3,1,1,32,2,12 which sum up to 51, and 3|1|1|32|2|12=(101111)2 has five 1s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.
