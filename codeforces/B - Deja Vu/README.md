You are given an array a of length n, consisting of positive integers, and an array x of length q, also consisting of positive integers.There are q modification. On the i-th modification (1≤i≤q), for each j (1≤j≤n), such that aj is divisible by 2xi, you add 2xi−1 to aj. Note that xi (1≤xi≤30) is a positive integer not exceeding 30.After all modification queries, you need to output the final array.

### Input
InputThe first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1≤n,q≤105) —the length of the array a and the number of queries respectively.The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,a3,…,an — the elements of the array a (1≤ai≤109).The third line of each test case contains q integers x1,x2,x3,…,xq — the elements of the array x (1≤xi≤30), which are the modification queries.It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

### Output
OutputFor each test case, output the array after all of the modification queries.
NoteIn the first test case, the first query will add 2 to the integers in positions 4 and 5. After this addition, the array would be [1,2,3,6,6]. Other operations will not modify the array.In the second test case, the first modification query does not change the array. The second modification query will add 8 to the integer in position 5, so that the array would look like this: [7,8,12,36,56,6,3]. The third modification query will add 2 to the integers in positions 2,3, 4 and 5. The array would then look like this: [7,10,14,38,58,6,3].
