# [C. The Legend of Freya the Frog](https://codeforces.com/contest/2009/problem/C)

---
Freya the Frog is traveling on the 2D coordinate plane. She is currently at point (0,0) and wants to go to point (x,y). In one move, she chooses an integer d such that 0≤d≤k and jumps d spots forward in the direction she is facing. Initially, she is facing the positive x direction. After every move, she will alternate between facing the positive x direction and the positive y direction (i.e., she will face the positive y direction on her second move, the positive x direction on her third move, and so on). What is the minimum amount of moves she must perform to land on point (x,y)?

### Input
InputThe first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.Each test case contains three integers x, y, and k (0≤x,y≤109,1≤k≤109).

### Output
OutputFor each test case, output the number of jumps Freya needs to make on a new line.
NoteIn the first sample, one optimal set of moves is if Freya jumps in the following way: (0,0) → (2,0) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,5) → (6,5) → (6,8) → (9,8) → (9,11). This takes 8 jumps.
