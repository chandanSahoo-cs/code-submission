# [A. Counting Orders](https://codeforces.com/contest/1827/problem/A)

---
You are given two arrays a and b each consisting of n integers. All elements of a are pairwise distinct.Find the number of ways to reorder a such that ai>bi for all 1≤i≤n, modulo 109+7.Two ways of reordering are considered different if the resulting arrays are different.

### Input
InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105) — the length of the array a and b.The second line of each test case contains n distinct integers a1, a2, …, an (1≤ai≤109) — the array a. It is guaranteed that all elements of a are pairwise distinct.The second line of each test case contains n integers b1, b2, …, bn (1≤bi≤109) — the array b.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

### Output
OutputFor each test case, output the number of ways to reorder array a such that ai>bi for all 1≤i≤n, modulo 109+7.
