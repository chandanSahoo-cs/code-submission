Teto is playing the hit rhythm game osu!. The game can be described by a binary string∗ s of length n and a positive integer k where the following will happen in order:  You will choose some positions in s to protect.  Then for each i (1≤i≤n) in increasing order, Teto can set si to 0 if all the following are true:   si=1,  si is not protected,  the previous k−1 elements do not contain 1. More formally, 1 does not occur in smax(1,i−k+1),…,si−1.  You dislike Teto (for some reason). So determine the minimum number of positions you need to protect to force her to leave s unchanged.∗A binary string is a string that only consists of characters 0 and 1.

### Input
InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤100). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each testcase contains integers n and k (2≤n≤1000; 2≤k≤n) — the length of s and k.The second line of each test case contains a binary string s of length n consisting of characters 0 and 1.The sum of n across all testcases does not exceed 1000.

### Output
OutputFor each testcase, output the minimum number of positions you need to protect to force Teto to leave the string unchanged.
NoteFor the first testcase, you can protect the first element and have: s=11. Now Teto cannot change s1 because it is protected and cannot change s2 because s1=1. It can be proven this is optimal.For the second testcase, you can protect only the first element and have s=100001. Teto cannot change s1 because it is protected and she cannot change s6 because there is 1 in the previous k−1 elements (100001).For the fourth testcase, you must protect s1,s3,s5,s7 and have s=1010101. It can be shown that this is optimal. For example, if you did not protect s3, then Teto can change it to 0 (1010101)
