---
There are n flowers in a row, the i-th of them initially has a positive height of hi meters.Every second, the wind will blow from the left, causing the height of some flowers to decrease.Specifically, every second, for each i from 1 to n, in this order, the following happens:   If i=n or hi>hi+1, the value of hi changes to max(0,hi−1). How many seconds will pass before hi=0 for all 1≤i≤n for the first time?

### Input
InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤105) — the number of flowers.The second line of each test case contains n integers h1,h2,…,hn (1≤hi≤109) — the heights of the flowers.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 105.

### Output
OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the number of seconds that will pass before hi=0 for all 1≤i≤n.
NoteIn the first test case, the flower heights change as follows: [1,1,2]→[1,1,1]→[1,1,0]→[1,0,0]→[0,0,0].In the second test case, the flower heights change as follows: [3,1]→[2,0]→[1,0]→[0,0].
