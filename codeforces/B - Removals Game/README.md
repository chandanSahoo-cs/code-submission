# [B. Removals Game](https://codeforces.com/contest/2002/problem/B)

---
Alice got a permutation a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an of [1,2,…,n][1,2,…,n], and Bob got another permutation b1,b2,…,bnb1,b2,…,bn of [1,2,…,n][1,2,…,n]. They are going to play a game with these arrays.In each turn, the following events happen in order:  Alice chooses either the first or the last element of her array and removes it from the array;  Bob chooses either the first or the last element of his array and removes it from the array. The game continues for n−1n−1 turns, after which both arrays will have exactly one remaining element: xx in the array aa and yy in the array bb.If x=yx=y, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. Find which player will win if both players play optimally.

### Input
InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases tt (1≤t≤1041≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (1≤n≤3⋅1051≤n≤3⋅105).The next line contains nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤n1≤ai≤n, all aiai are distinct) — the permutation of Alice.The next line contains n integers b1,b2,…,bn (1≤bi≤n, all bi are distinct) — the permutation of Bob.It is guaranteed that the sum of all n does not exceed 3⋅105.

### Output
OutputFor each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print Alice; otherwise, print Bob.
NoteIn the first test case, Bob can win the game by deleting the same element as Alice did.In the second test case, Alice can delete 3 in the first turn, and then in the second turn, delete the element that is different from the one Bob deleted in the first turn to win the game.
