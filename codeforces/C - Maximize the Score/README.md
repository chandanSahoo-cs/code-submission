# [C. Maximize the Score](https://codeforces.com/contest/2248/problem/C)

---
You are given an array a of length 2n. Each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a.Initially, your score is 0.You can repeatedly perform the following operation while a is non-empty:  Choose an integer x that is present in a.  Let l and r be the indices of the leftmost and rightmost occurrences of x in the current array, respectively. If x occurs only once, then l=r.  Add (r−l+1)2 to your score.  Delete the elements al,al+1,…,ar from a. The remaining elements are concatenated without changing their order and re-indexed starting from 1. Find the maximum possible score after making the array empty.

### Input
InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105).The second line contains 2n integers a1,a2,…,a2n (1≤ai≤n).It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

### Output
OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the maximum possible score.
NoteIn the second test case, one optimal strategy is to choose x=1 first. This deletes the subarray [1,2,1] and adds 32=9 to the score. The remaining array is [2]; choosing x=2 adds 1. The total score is 10.In the third test case, choosing x=1 deletes the whole array and adds 42=16 to the score.In the fourth test case, choose x=1 first and then choose x=2. The total score is 22+42=20.In the sixth test case, choose x=2 first. This deletes the subarray [2,3,4,1,2] from the middle of the array and adds 52=25 to the score. After deleting this subarray and concatenating the remaining elements, the array becomes [1,3,4]. Choosing each of the three remaining values then adds 1, so the total score is 28.
