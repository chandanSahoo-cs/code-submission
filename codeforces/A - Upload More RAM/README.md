# [A. Upload More RAM](https://codeforces.com/contest/1987/problem/A)

---
Oh no, the ForceCodes servers are running out of memory! Luckily, you can help them out by uploading some of your RAM!You want to upload n GBs of RAM. Every second, you will upload either 0 or 1 GB of RAM. However, there is a restriction on your network speed: in any k consecutive seconds, you can upload only at most 1 GB of RAM in total.Find the minimum number of seconds needed to upload n GBs of RAM!

### Input
InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1≤n,k≤100) — the number of GBs that you want to upload and the length of the time window respectively.

### Output
OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of seconds needed to upload n GBs of RAM.
NoteIn the first test case, you can upload 1 GB of RAM per second, so to upload 5 GBs, you need 5 seconds.In the second test case, you can upload 1 GB in the first second, 0 GBs in the second second, and 1 GB in the third second, which in total adds up to exactly 2 GBs of uploaded RAM.In the third test case, you can upload 1 GB in the first second, 0 GBs in the second second, 0 GBs in the third second, and 1 GB in the fourth second, which in total adds up to exactly 2 GBs of uploaded RAM.
