# [B. Outstanding Impressionist](https://codeforces.com/contest/2053/problem/B)

If it was so, then let's make it a deal...— MayDay, GentlenessEven after copying the paintings from famous artists for ten years, unfortunately, Eric is still unable to become a skillful impressionist painter. He wants to forget something, but the white bear phenomenon just keeps hanging over him.Eric still remembers n pieces of impressions in the form of an integer array. He records them as w1,w2,…,wn. However, he has a poor memory of the impressions. For each 1≤i≤n, he can only remember that li≤wi≤ri.Eric believes that impression i is unique if and only if there exists a possible array w1,w2,…,wn such that wi≠wj holds for all 1≤j≤n with j≠i.Please help Eric determine whether impression i is unique for every 1≤i≤n, independently for each i. Perhaps your judgment can help rewrite the final story.

### Input
InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105) — the number of impressions.Then n lines follow, the i-th containing two integers li and ri (1≤li≤ri≤2⋅n) — the minimum possible value and the maximum possible value of wi.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

### Output
OutputFor each test case, output a binary string s of length n: for each 1≤i≤n, if impression i is unique, si=1; otherwise, si=0. Do not output spaces.
NoteIn the first test case, the only possible array w is [1,1], making neither impression 1 nor 2 unique (since w1=w2).In the second test case, all impressions can be made unique:  For i=1, we can set w to [1,3,2,3], in which w1≠w2, w1≠w3, and w1≠w4;  For i=2, we can set w to [2,3,1,2], in which w2≠w1, w2≠w3, and w2≠w4;  For i=3, we can set w to [1,1,3,1];  For i=4, we can set w to [2,3,3,1]. In the third test case, for i=4, we can set w to [3,2,2,1,3,2]. Thus, impression 4 is unique.
