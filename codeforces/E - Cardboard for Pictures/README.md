# [E. Cardboard for Pictures](https://codeforces.com/contest/1850/problem/E)

---
Mircea has nn pictures. The i-th picture is a square with a side length of si centimeters. He mounted each picture on a square piece of cardboard so that each picture has a border of w centimeters of cardboard on all sides. In total, he used c square centimeters of cardboard. Given the picture sizes and the value c, can you find the value of w?  A picture of the first test case. Here c=50=52+42+32, so w=1 is the answer. Please note that the piece of cardboard goes behind each picture, not just the border.

### Input
InputThe first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two positive integers n (1≤n≤2⋅105) and c (1≤c≤1018) — the number of paintings, and the amount of used square centimeters of cardboard.The second line of each test case contains n space-separated integers si (1≤si≤104) — the sizes of the paintings.The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅105.Additional constraint on the input: Such an integer w exists for each test case.Please note, that some of the input for some test cases won't fit into 32-bit integer type, so you should use at least 64-bit integer type in your programming language (like long long for C++).

### Output
OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the value of w (w≥1) which was used to use exactly c squared centimeters of cardboard.
NoteThe first test case is explained in the statement.For the second test case, the chosen w was 2, thus the only cardboard covers an area of c=(2⋅2+6)2=102=100 squared centimeters.For the third test case, the chosen w was 4, which obtains the covered area c=(2⋅4+2)2×5=102×5=100×5=500 squared centimeters.
