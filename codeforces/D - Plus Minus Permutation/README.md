# [D. Plus Minus Permutation](https://codeforces.com/contest/1872/problem/D)

---
You are given 3 integers — n, x, y. Let's call the score of a permutation† p1,…,pn the following value:(p1⋅x+p2⋅x+…+p⌊nx⌋⋅x)−(p1⋅y+p2⋅y+…+p⌊ny⌋⋅y)In other words, the score of a permutation is the sum of pi for all indices i divisible by x, minus the sum of pi for all indices i divisible by y.You need to find the maximum possible score among all permutations of length n.For example, if n=7, x=2, y=3, the maximum score is achieved by the permutation [2,6_,1_,7_,5,4__,3] and is equal to (6+7+4)−(1+4)=17−5=12.† A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (the number 2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3, but the array contains 4).

### Input
InputThe first line of input contains an integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.Then follows the description of each test case.The only line of each test case description contains 3 integers n, x, y (1≤n≤109, 1≤x,y≤n).

### Output
OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the maximum score among all permutations of length n.
NoteThe first test case is explained in the problem statement above.In the second test case, one of the optimal permutations will be [12,11,2_,4,8,9__,10,6,1_,5,3,7__]. The score of this permutation is (9+7)−(2+9+1+7)=−3. It can be shown that a score greater than −3 can not be achieved. Note that the answer to the problem can be negative.In the third test case, the score of the permutation will be (p1+p2+…+p9)−p9. One of the optimal permutations for this case is [9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1], and its score is 44. It can be shown that a score greater than 44 can not be achieved.In the fourth test case, x=y, so the score of any permutation will be 0.
