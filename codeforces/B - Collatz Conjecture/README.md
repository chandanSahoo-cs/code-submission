# [B. Collatz Conjecture](https://codeforces.com/contest/1982/problem/B)

---
Recently, the first-year student Maxim learned about the Collatz conjecture, but he didn't pay much attention during the lecture, so he believes that the following process is mentioned in the conjecture:There is a variable x and a constant y. The following operation is performed k times:   increase x by 1, then  while the number x is divisible by y, divide it by y.  Note that both of these actions are performed sequentially within one operation.For example, if the number x=16, y=3, and k=2, then after one operation x becomes 17, and after another operation x becomes 2, because after adding one, x=18 is divisible by 3 twice.Given the initial values of x, y, and k, Maxim wants to know what is the final value of x.

### Input
InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases.The only line of each test case contains three integers x, y, and k (1≤x,k≤109, 2≤y≤109) — the initial variable, constant and the number of operations.

### Output
OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the number obtained after applying k operations.
NoteIn the first test case, there is only one operation applied to x=1, resulting in x becoming 2.In the second test case, for x=2, within one operation, one is added to x and it's divided by y=3, resulting in x becoming 1.In the third test case, x changes as follows:  After the first operation, x=1, because 24+1=25 and 25 is divisible by y=5 twice within one operation.  After the second operation, x=2.  After the third operation, x=3.  After the fourth operation, x=4.  After the fifth operation, x=1.
