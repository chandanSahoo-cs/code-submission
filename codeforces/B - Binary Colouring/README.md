You are given a positive integer x. Find any array of integers a0,a1,…,an−1 for which the following holds:   1≤n≤32,  ai is 1, 0, or −1 for all 0≤i≤n−1,  x=n−1∑i=0ai⋅2i,  There does not exist an index 0≤i≤n−2 such that both ai≠0 and ai+1≠0. It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array always exists.

### Input
InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1≤x<230).

### Output
OutputFor each test case, output two lines.On the first line, output an integer n (1≤n≤32) — the length of the array a0,a1,…,an−1.On the second line, output the array a0,a1,…,an−1.If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.
NoteIn the first test case, one valid array is [1], since (1)⋅20=1.In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,−1,0,0,1], since (0)⋅20+(−1)⋅21+(0)⋅22+(0)⋅23+(1)⋅24=−2+16=14.
