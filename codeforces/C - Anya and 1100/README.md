# [C. Anya and 1100](https://codeforces.com/contest/2036/problem/C)

---
While rummaging through things in a distant drawer, Anya found a beautiful string s consisting only of zeros and ones.Now she wants to make it even more beautiful by performing q operations on it.Each operation is described by two integers i (1≤i≤|s|) and v (v∈{0,1}) and means that the i-th character of the string is assigned the value v (that is, the assignment si=v is performed).But Anya loves the number 1100, so after each query, she asks you to tell her whether the substring "1100" is present in her string (i.e. there exist such 1≤i≤|s|−3 that sisi+1si+2si+3=1100).

### Input
InputThe first line contains one integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.The first line of the test case contains the string s (1≤|s|≤2⋅105), consisting only of the characters "0" and "1". Here |s| denotes the length of the string s.The next line contains an integer q (1≤q≤2⋅105) — the number of queries.The following q lines contain two integers i (1≤i≤|s|) and v (v∈{0,1}), describing the query.It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105. It is also guaranteed that the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

### Output
OutputFor each query, output "YES", if "1100" is present in Anya's string; otherwise, output "NO".You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.
